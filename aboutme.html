       <h1>Who I Am.</h1>
       <p> I am a designer who aspires to bring change through intuitive composition and delightful experiences. The process of problem-solving has always been innate for me. I am energized by a problem’s complexities. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work in different industries and partake in unique roles, and I believe my diverse experience has made me a humble person who is equipped with skills that are crucial for a designer. As an effective communicator and an empathetic problem solver, I am passionate about speaking the user’s language and creating solutions that address their pain points. My background in psychology and business has helped me understand the user in a pragmatic way allowing me to achieve harmony by building products with both the user and company goals in mind. </span> </p>

         <h1> how did I get here? </h1>
         <p> From childhood I was always a people person.  I always wanted to be around different types of people, and observing their habits and motivations.</p>
         <p> In university, I decided to purse my Bachelors in Psychology. It fascinated me to take a step up from observing people, to understanding the decisions and choices they make.</p>
         <p> After graduating I received a wonderful opportunity to teach English abroad in rural India.  The experience was life-changing and I knew that whatever career choice I would choose in the end, I would want to make a substantial impact on others. </p>
         <p> During my time in India, my sister encouraged me to enroll in a few online courses focused on web design. Along with the courses, I started experimenting with Illustrator and Sketch, teaching myself design and front-end skills. </p>
         <p> After coming back to the states, I was introduced me to UX design.  My constant curiosity at people’s behaviors, my background in psychology, and now my web design skills could come together into one dream job. And thus began my journey into becoming a UX designer.</p>
